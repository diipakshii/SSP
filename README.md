# SSP 2022 
I have compiled my code from SSP (Summer Science Program) 2022 in this repository. 

It contains all the code for the orbital determination of Near-Earth Asteroid 2015 HH10 using data from the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile, the Sommers-Bausch Observatory at the University of Colorado Boulder, and the Morehead Observatory at the University of North Carolina,
Chapel Hill, as well as code from PSETs and lecture.
