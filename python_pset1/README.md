## Section Breakdown
### python_pset1_angle.py
This file includes three functions to convert angles provided in degrees, minutes, and seconds into decimal degrees, with optional conversion to radians and normalization. 
- Basic Angle Conversion: converts an angle from degrees, minutes, and seconds into decimal degrees
- Conversion to Radians: extends the basic conversion by adding an option to convert the result from decimal degrees to radians
- Normalization: extends the conversion by adding an option to normalize the angle. Normalization ensures the angle is within the range of [0, 360) degrees or [0, 2π) radians.

### python_pset1_coordinate.py
This file includes a function to calculate the distance between two locations on Earth using spherical coordinates.

### python_pset1_warmup.py 
This file was a python warmup. Includes 3 functions to sum a list of numbers, estimate the value of π, and scale a vector by a scalar.
