### [python_pset3_OrbitViz.py](https://github.com/diipakshii/SSP/blob/main/python_pset3/python_pset3_OrbitViz.py)
This file simulates the orbit of an asteroid using Kepler's equations and vector transformations. The simulation is visualized using the vpython library, which provides a 3D rendering of the asteroid's motion around the Sun. The code calculates the position of the asteroid in its orbit by solving Kepler's equation and applying coordinate transformations to account for orbital elements such as inclination, eccentricity, and the argument of perihelion.
